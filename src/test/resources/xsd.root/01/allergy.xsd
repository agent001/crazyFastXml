      This section is used to describe a patients allergies and intolerances to various substances.  The section defines a number of 
      codedValue sections which are constrained to particular coding system (SNOMED CT) which are described below.
      
      The date element is used to state the date of the last reaction to the allergy or intolerance.
      
      The product element is a coded value used to describe the substance the patient has the allergy or intolerance too.  There currently is 
      not a constraint defined on the code system or code values which can be used to coded the product. At the very least a free text description
      the substance must be supplied as the value of the product element with implementers free to choose the coding system of their choice.
      
      
      This section also contains optional informationSource and description elements which are defined and documented in the 
      abstractSection type declared in the hdata core.xsd schema file.

        be expressed  using the VA/KP Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT, and shall be terms that descend from 
        the clinical finding (404684003) concept. The OID for this vocabulary is 2.16.840.1.113883.6.96. The problem list subset
